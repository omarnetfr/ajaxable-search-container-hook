## Ajaxable search container paginator (https://www.liferay.com/fr/marketplace/-/mp/application/24727673) :

This hook allows you to make the liferay search container ajaxable, indeed when you click on the navigation buttons that load the whole page which can be easily seen on a page that contains many portlets, thanks to the hook just the contents of the portlet that contain the search container will be reloaded with the Liferay's loader.
This hook has been tested with a search container that use both page iteraror and search iterator.
